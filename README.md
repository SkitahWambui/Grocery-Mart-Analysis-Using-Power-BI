## Superstore US Sales Analysis
### Project Summary

This project involves creating a comprehensive sales dashboard for a hypothetical Superstore in the United States using Power BI. The dataset includes sales, profit, and quantity information from 2012 to 2015, categorized by region, state, product category, and customer segment.

Key steps in the project included:  
1. **Data Transformation**: Using Power Query, the raw data was cleaned, reshaped, and prepared for analysis. Tasks included handling missing values, merging tables, and creating calculated columns for enhanced insights.  
2. **DAX Functions**: Advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions were used to calculate metrics such as total sales, profit margins, and year-over-year growth. These measures enabled dynamic, real-time insights into business performance.
